 Release notes
===============

DISCOVER packages are made available for both Python and R. The
packages for both languages expose the same set of features and a
similar programming interface, where differences in the latter only
serve to conform to language-specific conventions. Increments of the
major or minor version number (e.g. 0.9 -> 1.0, or 1.0 -> 1.1) will be
made upon the introduction of substantial new features. Bug fixes or
smaller new features are introduced in the patch releases
(e.g. 0.9.1). Whereas the major and minor release series will always
be kept in sync between Python and R, patch releases may be published
independently. In other words, version 0.9.3 of the Python package
would not have more functionality than version 0.9.1 of the R package;
it would simply have required more bug fixes. However, version 1.0.0
of the Python package would have features that do not exist in version
0.9.1 of the R package.
